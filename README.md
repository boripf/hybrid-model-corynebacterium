# hybrid-model-corynebacterium
Hybrid semi-parametric model that includes a mechanistic model and a data-driven model. Application for the fermentation of Corynebacterium glutamicum.

The different models are saved in the file def_model.py and then imported to the jupyter notebook sim_models.ipynb where the models are tested and compared with the experimental data.
In the folder 'fermentation raw data' one can find the file data_combined.csv with all fermentation tags aligned based on the timestamp.
